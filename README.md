# NYU_CS_BridgeProgram

##### Program Objectives

- Basic understanding of how data is represented and how computers execute instructions to use and modify data in order to solve problems.
- Understanding of computational thinking: how to develop algorithms using decisions, repetition, and decomposition into manageable components to solve problems.
- Ability to implement and test moderate sized programs in C++, using constructs including variables, operators, decision statements, loops, functions, and built-in data types.
